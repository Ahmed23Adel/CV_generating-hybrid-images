Generating Hypbrid images:

In simple words, a hybrid image is a combination of two images, we extract a low frequency from one image,
extract the high frequency of another image, and add them together, supposedly; that creates an image that
might have different perceptions from the human eye based on how close human eye to the image is. If the
human eye is very close to the image, It is supposed that it will focus on every little detail, hence detecting the
high-frequency image clearer, but if they are away from the image, or the image is very small, it will focus on
low-frequency image, as though they have an overview of the image.

We also used FFT in convolution it improved the perfomance a lot.
